# Sprint 2 
make a LP as much as possible similar to the provided design with Bootstrap 5

Min requiremets:
- Install Bootstrap in the project, don't use cdn (which is loading via link, such as "<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/.... ." rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">").

- Use Bootstrap navBar component.

- Use Bootstrap's Responsive Grid, as it should look good on tablet and mobile.

- Modify with SASS, using the file created by you "main.scss", the main and secondary color of Bootstrap. Use these variables for the color of the buttons.

Main color: #fca311
Secondary color: #14213d
